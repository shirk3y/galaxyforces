Installation Instructions of jIRC applet
-----------------------------------------
Uncompress the zip file(well, you must have done it already to read this file.) 
into one directory of your web site.
Please do not uncompress jrc_nss.zip or jirc_mss.cab
as it will break the digital signature. 

Simply point your browser to different chat*.html file, and the applet 
will be loaded. 

Remember that the *.zip and *.cab file must be in the same directory of 
the "chat*.html".

Note: Some web servers do not recognized the file type *.cab and thus return
MIME null or text/html to the browser and causing "Class Not Found" error 
in IE4 and some IE5. 
A quick fix to this installation problem is to rename the jirc_mss.cab file to 
jirc_mss.bin and change the name accordingly in the chat*.html. 



Configuration
--------------
You are welcome to customize the parameters inside the html file to fit your
web contents. 
This can be done by modifying the <param name="" value=""> tag inside html file.

    * We are currently looking for the best set of button images to use, be sure to let us know if you find one! 

Added right click menu on user list

    * UserMenuList paramter is added use for creating user popup menu
    * Example : "Send File=/dccsend %$HN,Private Message=/msg %$HN,Ignore=/ignore %$HN,Whois=/whois %$HN,See User Profile=/showprofile %$HN"

    * If CopyMethod parameter is set to "JVM", the text is directly save into user computer's system clipboard. And can be paste into any other application using application's paste command.

    * If CopyMethod parameter is set to "JS", the text will be sent to a javascript function called "jirc_copytext" as one of the argument. The javascript function will then print out a simple window with the copied text user selected from chat screen, and user can further copy from that window just like any HTML content.
